## Slice Node.js Skeleton App
---

This is a skeleton application for use with Slice's [Node.js](https://github.com/slicedev/slice-node) SDK.  It implements the "Quick Hello World" flow as described [here](http://devdocs.slice.com/resources/hello).  

 **Instructions**
---

Make sure you have Node.js installed.  Once you do, run the following commands:
1.  `npm install`
1.  `node app.js`

The app will be using http://localhost:3000 by default.  It can be modified in `app.js`.
